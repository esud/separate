Separate - PHP Template Engine
==============================
Separate, is an object-oriented Template Engine for PHP. With Separate, it is possible to separate business logic (e.g. reading data from the database) from the presentation layer and thus produce a neat, clear and well-structured source code. In the course of this, generation of complete HTML pages is managed by the Template Engine.
